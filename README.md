"Portable Spotify Stand and listen."

Standify can use wav files which you can import each favorite music, it's for Stand Mod Menu. Inspired by Lance to get Music Sounds.

Inspired X-Force features and Lance's Startup Sounds which we can upload own musics but Stand don't have these features.

```
- Compatible All Stand Versions.
- Multi Language Included (English (default), French, German, Spanish, Russian)
- .wav file compatible and refresh music features.
- Random Music for using one-click action.
```

Installation
--------------------

1. Copy 'Standify.lua' to %appdata%\Stand\Lua Scripts
2. Copy 'lib' and 'store' folder into %appdata%\Stand\Lua Scripts
3. Done and enjoy your music.

NOTE: One of musics having different format files like .mp3, .wgg, .ogg, etc... are not compatible with Stand. So be advise, use .wav converter music to work.
- No volume settings added because the .dll file does not provide volume control functionality

How to drag .wav file?
- Drag into Standify Folder (to be precise, not your "stop_sounds", it will reserved only for stopping sounds.

Q&A
---

Why the Stop Sound won't work?
- R: You don't have dragged your folder called "Standify" which include stop_sounds "Stand\Lua Scripts\store\Standify"

Why I can't use .mp3 format file?
- R: mp3 are restricted because .wav becomes a standard at the expense of .mp3 because it is linked to the aalib.dll file.

How to convert .mp3 files to .wav file and why .wav file still heavy?
- R: You can convert mp3 files & compress files to reduce size: "Stand > Lua Scripts > Standify > Miscellaneous > WAV Compress & Converter"

Why the sound is too loud?
- R: You can amplify the sound by using various software like Audacity, Premiere Pro, etc... Then we don't have volume parameter because the .dll file don't provide volume control.
